<p> As a child I enjoyed taking things apart to understand how they worked. As you can imagine, that drove my mother crazy.</p>
          
<p> For the last 15 years, I've worked for Fortune 500 companies, start-ups and non-profits doing networking and IT managment.</p>

<p>Today, I focus on building Ruby on Rails and AngularJs apps and learning other frameworks.</p>

## Skills
I've used RoR to make most if not all of my web applications. I use Heroku or my own private Linux server to host my apps.
          For my web-based apps, I used AnguarJs, EmberJs, HTML, (Bootstrap), CSS MeteorJs (learning) and number of SQL variants including MySQL, MsSQL, PostgreSQL. 
          However, I wouldn't call myslef a DBA.
         
I'm a major supportor of AWS <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">(Amazon Web Services).</a> Great solutions for startup's and non-profit organzations. Check them out if you haven't.

I've setup and impliemented both Windows and Linux environments for the last 15 years. I also do a little bit of DevOps.
